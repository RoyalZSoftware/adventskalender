# You don't need to be smart
## Showing up everyday is worth more
I thought about this recently. It does not matter whether you are smart or not. Indeed it helps, but the actual success does not come from being smart.

## Success comes from work
Instead of thinking, that you're really smart, you might even think you're dumber than the average and compensate that with more work.
With that approach you're not resting on your high intelligence and don't waste your precious potential.

### Real life anecdote
I found that, the perfect example is from my school time. Back then, when colleagues compared themselves by (not their grades in this case) but their IQ points.

There were persons, that took a iq tests when they were 6+ years old and this made them relax on their high iq, like the score would fix anything in their lives.

## Working a lot teaches you a lot
If, for example, you are like me, a software developer and you're thinking outside the box, more than just your daily work.
You will soon see that there is more. You will soon get a deeper understanding of what you do on a daily basis and maybe combine the learned from both worlds.

## I need motiviation
Another quote, from one of my closest friends. "I need motiviation".
In my opinion, this is just another excuse to do something, that you actually have to do to achieve your goals.

Let's say I want to graduate in a specific subject and I have to take a test for it.
I really want it and taking the test is the only way to achieve this. For the test I need to learn a lot.
I can't just say "yes I will do it when I have the motiviation".
In such cases I am the only person who is responsible for achieving my goal and you I be able to blame somebody else.

Waiting for the motiviation to arise will make you waste a lot of precious time. There are days when I do not want to do something, but I still do it. Because that's the only way to achieve a specific goal.

## Conclusion
You're not doing something because you're motivated. You do something, because that's the only way to achieve a goal.
