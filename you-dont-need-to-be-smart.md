# You don't need to be smart
## Showing up everyday is worth more

I thought about this recently. It does not matter whether you are smart or not. Indeed it helps, but the actual success does not come from being smart.

## Success comes from work
Instead of thinking, that you're really smart, you might even think you're dumer than the average and compensate that with more work.
With that approach you're not resting on your high intelligence. I found that, the perfect example came from my school time, when colleagues compared themselves by (not their grades in this case) but their IQ points.

There were persons that took a test when they were 6+ years old and this made them relax on their high iq, like the score would fix anything in your life.

## Working a lot teach you a lot
If you work a lot on yourself and on some projects that you draw inspiration from will teach you a lot. If for example you're as me, a software developer and you're looking over the tellerrand, over your daily work.
You will soon see that there is more and with further disciplines you get a deeper understanding of what you do on a daily basis and maybe combine those two factors.

## I need motiviation
Another real life story, from one of my closest friends. "I need motiviation". In my opinion, this is just another excuse to do something that you actually have to do to achieve your goals.

Let's say I want to graduate in a specific subject and I have to take a test for it. I really want it and taking the test is the only way to achieve this. For the test I need to learn a lot.
You can't just say "yes I will do it when I have the motiviation". In such cases you are the only person who is responsible for achieving the goal and you won't be able to blame somebody else.
